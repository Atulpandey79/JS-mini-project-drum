# JavaScript Mini Project
This is my first and simple project using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## The Project
# ![The Project](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85121357/133914979-3ae16b2f-b963-4653-97e1-70eec3e5408d.jpeg)

## Designing HTML
- For the website, I only have seven buttons to display on the page, clicking upon which sound would be played.
- First I added the DOCTYPE HTML format, then give a suitable title to the web page, in my case it is The Drum Beats.
- Inside the body tag, I gave a heading, say, The Drum Kit using h1 tag and display those seven buttons.

## The Styling 
- Gave color, background color, font-family, margin and font size to the body and the heading.
- I gave background images of drums, cymbals, etc. to every button to make the page more attractive.

## The JavaScript Part
-  I added script tag to the HTML document linking it with the JavaScript file (before closing the body tag).
-  Then added event listeners to all the buttons. 
-  Added keypress function which will describe what will happen when a particular key is produced.
-  Then I coded sound() function. It tells which sound should be played when we press or/and click a specific key.
